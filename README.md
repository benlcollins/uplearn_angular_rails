# uplearn_angular_rails

This is a test app I'm building as I learn AngularJS and how to integrate an AngularJS front-end with a Rails back-end.

This app is on heroku here: https://friendly-pylon-6828.herokuapp.com/

The goal is to rebuild my previous site UpLearn (see it here: https://uplearn.herokuapp.com/) with an Angular front-end.
