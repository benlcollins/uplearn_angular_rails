# uplearn_angular_rails

This is a test app I'm building as I learn AngularJS and how to integrate an AngularJS front-end with a Rails back-end. I'm rebuilding my previous site UpLearn (see it here: https://uplearn.herokuapp.com/) with an Angular front-end and this app is a testing platform.

This test app exists on heroku here: https://friendly-pylon-6828.herokuapp.com/
