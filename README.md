# UpLearn-JS

## What is it?

UpLearn-JS (https://uplearn-js.herokuapp.com/) is the javascript version of my original Rails app, UpLearn (https://uplearn.herokuapp.com/). Conceived as a place to find and share the best digital learning resources, UpLearn-JS allows users to share links which can be viewed, commented on and upvoted by the community.

I'm building this app using AngularJS (version 1.3.16 right now) and Bootstrap on the front-end, connected to a PostgreSQL database and Rails app on the back-end. It's been challenging and fun to build. There are many features and bug issues that I'm still working on...
